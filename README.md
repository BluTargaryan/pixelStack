## Demo

### Homepage

The layout is kind of made similar to [Medium.com](https://medium.com) because it is a good design and thought it would be better use it for my project

### Login and Signup
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/login.png" alt="Login Modal" style="width: 100%;">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/register.png" alt="Signup Modal" style="width: 100%;">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
These are a single modal component that are populated based on which button the user has clicked (Sign in or Get Started)

To create a Blog, simply 3 fields are to be filled

The Blog content can be well formatted by making the use of [React Quill Text Editor](https://zenoamaro.github.io/react-quill/)

This was the complete walkthough for PixelStack. This was a good project in MERN Stack which involved building everything from scratch.
